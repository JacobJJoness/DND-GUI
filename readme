DND Project - Object Oriented Programming

This program is being designed for users to quickly generate 
DND characters. Ideally the program will utilize a GUI interface
and allow the user to save characters to files for later reference.
Additonally, the user will eventually be able to also set conditions
for the character to meet. Such as higher standards of stats for the 
character, name, etc.

Current Classes Below

character Class: Main data structure and generator of random character data.

fileHandler Class: Handles loading and saving files for the character data.

GUI Class: this class will serve as the GUI for the program, and hold our main function.




FOLDERS

Public folder is to be used for storing things the user actually sees. For instance, image files that are displayed on the screen.

static folder: We should be using this folder to store files that do not change and are used for simplisitic storage. For instance,
we may store static data here for the character class to generate names.
