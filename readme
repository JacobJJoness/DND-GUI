DND Project - Object Oriented Programming

This program is being designed for users to quickly generate 
DND characters. Ideally the program will utilize a GUI interface
and allow the user to save characters to files for later reference.
Additonally, the user will eventually be able to also set conditions
for the character to meet. Such as higher standards of stats for the 
character, name, etc.
